// The in-VR typing surface. It lives in userspace beside the dash rather than inside it: a focused
// field can be on the dash, on a world panel or on an inspector, and one keyboard has to reach all
// three. Keys drive the focused TextInput through its public typing surface, so the caret, the
// selection replace and the length clamp are the same code the hardware keyboard runs.
//
// Showing is driven by focus, not by a button: TextInput has no focus-changed event, so this polls
// the single static focus each common update. That poll has to keep running while the panel is
// HIDDEN, which is why CanRunUpdates drops the active-slot gate below - an inactive slot gets no
// updates, and a keyboard that only wakes up while it is already visible never appears. The update
// order puts that poll ahead of UserspacePointer (-1000), so the frame the panel appears is already
// the frame a laser wakes for it rather than a frame of keyboard nothing can press. -xlinka
