// Pins a scroll content's HEIGHT the way the working scrollers do (code editor / session / helio scroll test):
// top-anchored content, set OffsetMin.y = -height, and touch NOTHING else (no computed-rect override, no
// re-anchoring - that churn re-meshes the content chunk and wipes the scroll's clip_offset).
//
// The height is dynamic (inspector rows expand/collapse), and this runs in OnUpdate - OUTSIDE the layout pass -
// so we CANNOT read the content container's aggregate metric (Measured.Preferred on a container needs its child
// list, only populated during ComputeRects; it reads 0 here, which is the bug that left content pinned at 100px).
// Instead we sum the CHILD rows' actual laid-out heights (LocalComputeRect.height), which ARE valid after a pass.
//
// LATCH on the row COUNT: a height that keeps wobbling by a few px from the async rebuild must not keep re-pinning
// (each write re-meshes the chunk). Re-pin only when the row set changes or the content grows past the pin; then
// go quiet so clip_offset holds. A section collapsing in place (count unchanged, height shrinks) leaves a little
// slack until the next structural change - deliberate. -xlinka
