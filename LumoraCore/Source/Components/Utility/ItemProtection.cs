// Marks what it sits on as not-yours-to-take. The datamodel gate reads it on the copy path and
// refuses a SaveCopy or an Export of the marked object for anyone who does not own it.
//
// THE OWNER ALWAYS PASSES, and that is decided in the gate, not here: AuthorizeCopy answers yes for a
// target the actor owns before it ever looks for a marker, and yes for the authority (a host is
// already holding every byte of the world in its own memory, so a marker that claimed to stop it
// would be theatre). So marking your own prop costs you nothing, and marking world content stops
// visitors rather than the person who built it.
//
// Nearest marker wins: the gate walks component -> slot -> slot lineage and takes the FIRST one it
// finds, so marking a container covers everything inside it without every child carrying its own.
// The flip side is that a DISABLED marker low in the tree shadows an enabled one above it - an
// authoring foot-gun, not a hole, since attaching a component to content you do not own is refused
// well before any of this.
//
// Persisted on purpose. A protection that evaporated on save/load would protect the object exactly
// until someone reloaded the world, which is not a protection. -xlinka
