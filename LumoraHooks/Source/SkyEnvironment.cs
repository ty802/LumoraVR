// Decides which sky hook actually gets to write the scene's WorldEnvironment.
//
// There is one WorldEnvironment node for the whole tree, but any number of worlds can be open at
// once and a world can hold both a Skybox and a GradientSkybox. Without a single arbiter each hook
// stomps the node in whatever order its change pass happened to drain, which is not the same order
// twice, and a hook tearing down would restore a snapshot taken before somebody else's claim - the
// sky ends up depending on load timing.
//
// So no sky hook touches the node. They hand over a built Environment and a priority; this picks the
// winner among the claims belonging to the FOCUSED world and applies exactly that one. Worlds stay
// loaded when the user switches away, so their claims stay registered and simply stop winning, and
// the bootstrap environment comes back when nothing claims at all. -xlinka
