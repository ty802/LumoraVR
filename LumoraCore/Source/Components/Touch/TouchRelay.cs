// The one thing a non-authority toucher writes.
//
// A probe only runs on the machine of the user driving it, and it used to dispatch the contact straight
// into the target - which meant the TOUCHER's peer authored every write the control and its responders
// made. On world content those writes belong to the host, so the gate refused them: on the toucher's own
// client first (a joiner's gate keeps the view-only preset, because the world mode's preset is only ever
// applied on the authority), and again on the host if the client were talked past its own check. Guests
// could not work world buttons at all.
//
// So a remote touch travels as a REQUEST. The relay is minted in the toucher's own RefID namespace -
// the one thing a user is always allowed to write - and carries just enough to rebuild the contact: what
// is being touched, both phases, the probe kind and hand, and the tip geometry depth-driven controls
// measure travel from. The authority reads it, re-checks the control's own gates with the relay's owner
// as the toucher, and runs the reaction itself, so everything that comes out of a guest's touch is
// host-authored. -xlinka
