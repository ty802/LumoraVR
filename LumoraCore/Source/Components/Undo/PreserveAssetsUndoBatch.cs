// Reversible "destroy but keep the shared assets": the strip runs as usual, and this record holds
// everything needed to put the object back exactly as it was, shared providers included.
//
// Two halves, because the two kinds of thing the strip removes have different escape routes.
//
// SLOTS are moved, never destroyed. An emptied slot goes to the undo graveyard instead of dying, so
// its RefID, its members and every reference aimed at it stay valid; undo is a reparent back to
// where it came from. Slots that KEPT a provider were already only moved (under the asset holder),
// so those reverse the same way. Nothing outside the object has to be re-bound, which is the whole
// point - the surviving providers are shared, and their users must not notice the round trip.
//
// COMPONENTS have no such route, since a component cannot change slots. Those are serialized while
// still live and re-attached on undo through the shared translator, so the references they held
// resolve back to their targets. What does not come back: [NonPersistent] member values, which the
// save path skips by design.
//
// Redo is not a replay of a recording, it re-runs the strip. The tree is back in its original shape
// by then, so the operation reaches the same answer and produces a fresh set of records. -xlinka
