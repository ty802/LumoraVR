/// <summary>
/// A small parametric hand model that generates wrist-local finger-node positions
/// from a per-finger curl (and splay) angle. Used to synthesize preset poses and
/// to apply curl/splay offsets, all in position space.
/// </summary>
// Kinematic model with eyeballed numbers. Coordinate convention (purely internal:
// HandPoseDriver consumes only direction-between-consecutive-nodes, so the absolute
// frame just has to be self-consistent):
//   +Z  fingers extend away from the wrist
//   -Y  palm-facing (curl flexes fingertips from +Z toward -Y)
//   +X  splay spread axis (toward the thumb side / away)
// A finger is a chain of straight segments. Each joint adds a cumulative flex
// rotation about the splay-adjusted knuckle X axis, so successive segments fold
// like real flexion (proximal bends a little, then intermediate and distal bend
// progressively more for a fist). Splay is a single rotation of the whole finger
// about Y at the knuckle.
//
// LIMITATION: lengths and the rest fan-out are approximate, hand-tuned placeholders
// in normalized wrist units - they are NOT measured anthropometry. Because the
// consumer uses only segment DIRECTIONS, absolute scale is irrelevant; only the
// relative segment lengths and the angles matter, and those are eyeballed. Good
// enough to read as idle/point/fist; refine against real hand data if needed.
