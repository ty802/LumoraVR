// Hands each level's renderers the distance band it should be visible in.
//
// There is no frame loop here and there is nothing to tick. The renderer already measures the
// distance to every instance for culling, so telling it a band means the LOD switch rides along on a
// test it was doing anyway; a hook that computed the current level itself would be doing the same
// work a second time, on the CPU, for every group in the world.
//
// The interesting part is the bookkeeping. A renderer that leaves a level - the level is removed, the
// slot is reparented, the group is destroyed - has to be handed an unbounded band back, or it keeps
// the band from a group that no longer applies to it and disappears at a distance for no visible
// reason. So the set of renderers touched last time is kept, and anything not in the new set is
// released. -xlinka
